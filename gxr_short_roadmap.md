**🗺️ GXR [Gen X Raider] Development Roadmap**

This document outlines two possible development paths for the GXR blockchain:
1. A scenario where external grant funding is secured
2. A self-funded scenario without any external financial support

The purpose is to present a realistic, transparent timeline for GXR's technical rollout and the potential impact of funding support.

## 📌 Scenario 1 — With Grant Support

| Phase | Timeframe              | Technical & Strategic Activities                                            |
|-------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1️⃣    | October / November 2025 | Initial activation of community farming bot                                 |
| 2️⃣    | January – April 2026    | Continued development: blockchain modules & bot relayer/farming system      |
| 3️⃣    | May – September 2026    | Community incentive distribution, technical education & bot upgrades        |
| 4️⃣    | October – December 2026 | Snapshot of farming activity, testnet launch, code audit & public release   |
| 5️⃣    | January – February 2027 | Mainnet launch, cross-chain bridge deployment, GXR/*donor chain* liquidity pool creation |

## 📌 Scenario 2 — Without Grant Support

| Phase | Estimated Timeline           | Technical Activities & Adjustments                                        |
|-------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1️⃣    | December 2025 / January 2026 | Gradual farming bot activation based on available resources                 |
| 2️⃣    | February – June 2026         | Core module development continues, some supporting systems may be delayed  |
| 3️⃣    | July – October 2026          | Phased reward implementation and education outreach                         |
| 4️⃣    | November 2026 – February 2027| Testnet & farming snapshot delayed slightly, audit schedule adjusted        |
| 5️⃣    | March – April 2027           | Mainnet launch and final cross-chain integrations                           |

📎 **Additional Notes:**

- All timelines are estimates and may shift depending on real-world conditions.
- All core features will still be delivered, but grant funding significantly accelerates the process, expands community outreach, and stabilizes early infrastructure.
- A modular development approach ensures GXR can remain agile and adaptive under both scenarios.
