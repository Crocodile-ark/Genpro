# 🌐 Blockchain Grant Overview

## 📋 Blockchains Covered

This proposal requests grants for the development and launch of **GXR [Gen X Raider]**, a new blockchain that prioritizes a no smart contract, no NFT, and no third-party token model. The project is targeting support from multiple blockchain ecosystems:

- **TON** (request in progress)
- **Sei** (request in progress)
- **Cosmos Hub (ATOM)**
- **Osmosis**
- **POKT Network** (request in progress)
- **Polygon**
- **Arbitrum**
- **Chainlink**

Our goal is to build synergistic bridges between blockchains to drive cross-ecosystem adoption and utility, particularly through IBC integration, automated relayers, and decentralized liquidity markets managed by validators.

> 📌 *Note: The list of blockchains may change—be reduced or expanded—depending on project needs and strategic direction.*

## 🎯 Grant Objectives

GXR is currently in active development. This grant aims to support:

1. **Development of the chain and internal modules**, fully **immutable**
2. **Initial community building**, education, and technical documentation
3. **Creation of cross-chain liquidity pools (LP)** to support GXR token trading as mainnet approaches
4. **Automated relayer bot**, which will:
   - Connect GXR to DEXs (TON, POKT, Osmosis, Polygon, etc.)
   - Manage automatic fee-sharing (validator, DEX pool, PoS pool)
   - Handle scheduled rebalancing
5. **Independent farming bot**, which will:
   - Provide farming incentives for the early community
   - Distribute rewards according to allocation
   - Remain disconnected from the main network to preserve security

## 💰 Blockchain Fund Allocation Estimates

To ensure transparency and fair distribution, each grant from partner blockchains will follow a baseline target of **$25,000 USD** (adjustable per network policy). Funds will be used proportionally as follows:

| Requirement                         | Allocation (%) | Estimated Funds (USD)                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 🔧 Technology Development           | 40%           | $10,000                                     |
| 🌱 Community Growth & Education     | 20%           | $5,000                                      |
| 💧 DEX Liquidity (LP)               | 40%           | $10,000 *(requested closer to mainnet)*     |

## 🔗 Additional Notes

- **Liquidity Pool (LP)** funds will not be used immediately and will instead be **requested again when mainnet is ready**, ensuring efficient fund utilization.
- GXR is a blockchain that **does not support smart contracts**, **does not have NFTs**, and **does not allow third-party tokens** — maintaining a strong focus on network stability.
- The relayer bot and farming bot are **two separate systems**, each with distinct functions and security models.
- The project is led by a **solo developer**, with light assistance from two collaborators (one helped clean up the original SDK folder structure, and another designed the logo), along with ongoing support from AI tools.

## ✍️ Initial Funding Focus

### ✅ Blockchains for Initial Grant Submission

- **TON**
- **Sei**
- **POKT**

Originally, I planned to request support from **TON** and **Cosmos Hub**, but due to proposal complexity and limited personal resources, I decided to focus initial grant applications on **TON**, **Sei**, and **POKT**.

This seed funding will cover urgent needs during the preparation and activation phase, including:

- 💡 **Initial farming bot** (for community reward distribution)
- 💻 **Development PC or laptop**
- 🌐 **Stable Wi-Fi & internet connection**
- 📱 **Dedicated phone for inter-chain communication and community support**

This approach ensures the project can proceed into public testing and documentation stages prior to mainnet launch.
